# Agent Guidelines

- Prefer clear, commented ES module code under `src/` with descriptive function and class names.
- Keep dependencies minimal; rely on CDNs for browser libraries instead of adding build steps.
- Favor readability over micro-optimizations; keep functions under ~60 lines when possible.
- Update documentation (`README.md`) whenever you add or change features in the web game.
- Keep UI text concise and friendly.
- When changing the version, bump it in both the README and the on-screen display so they stay in sync.
